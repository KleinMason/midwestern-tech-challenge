# Midwestern Tech Challenge

**_Please be aware this project is still in development and parts of it may be changed in the near future._**

My mono-repo solution for the Midwestern Tech Challenge.  
Currently, the solution consists of these projects:

1. client - A React application that serves as the front-end for the solution.
2. server - A Node.js application using Express that serves as the back-end for the solution (**_Scaffolded but not yet implemented_**).
3. database - A MySql database that stores the data for the solution (**_Scaffolded but not implemented_**).

## Getting Started

To start the application, navigate to the directory of your choice and clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KleinMason/midwestern-tech-challenge.git
```

Then, navigate into the newly created directory and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install &&
npm run restore &&
npm run serve
```

The application should now be running on `localhost:5173` (the port will be different if 5173 is already in use).

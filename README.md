# Midwestern Tech Challenge

**Please be aware this project is still in development and parts of it may be changed in the near future.**

My mono-repo solution for the Midwestern Tech Challenge.  
Currently, this repo only contains a client-side application built with React. Shortly, I will add a server-side application built with Node.js + Express and a database.

## Getting Started

To start the application, navigate to the directory of your choice and clone the repo:  
`git clone https://github.com/KleinMason/midwestern-tech-challenge.git`  
Then, navigate into the newly created directory and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install &&
npm run restore &&
npm run serve
```

The application should now be running on `localhost:5173` (the port will be different if 5173 is already in use).
